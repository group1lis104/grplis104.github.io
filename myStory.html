        <h1>MY STORY</h1>
		
		<h3>Godfrey Orateng</h3>
        <p>Hello. My name is Godfrey Orateng and I have overcome addiction. <br> I have been addicted to cocaine since 2007 until the day i decided to take control of my life and fight the addiction. It was not easy to overcome the addiction as I started using the drug at a young age. Fighting addiction is not easy, along the way, you are going to feel like its impossible because your body is already used to the drug. Addiction is dangerous, it destroys lives and families. I almost lost everything because of my behaviour after using drugs, my friends, family, job and property. That is when i decided to take a stand, before it was too late. You can do it too, just make a decision and fight that addiction. Remember, its possible to let go.</p>
		
		
		<h3>Mogomotsi Bagasi</h3>
        <p>Hello. My name is Mogomotsi Bagasi and I have overcome addiction. <br> I started using drugs when I was a teenager because all my friends were using them and I felt left out. At first, we were just doing it for fun until the drugs became a part of us. We got caught in addiction and we used drugs everyday. We dropped out of school and started living in the streets at young age. We got involved in criminal activies and we have been put behind bars several times. One day i decided to see professional help because i was tired of this addiction. It was not easy, but i made it. I became clean. It has been 4 years now and I havent used any drug. You can do it too, you can overcome that addiction. Remember, there is no addiction to big for a determined heart.</p>
